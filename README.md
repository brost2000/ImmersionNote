<h1>Immersion: An Anki Note Type</h1>
<div class="body">
  <p>This note type is designed to follow the Catppuccin colorway https://catppuccin.com/palette/ and is meant to be a minimal template for language-learning based sentence mining. My goal with this note type is to follow a clean, minimal design style while being able to render (specifically Japanese) fonts correctly. It can easily be integrated with Yomitan for easy sentence mining.</p>
